  ## Description
  The Note Taker is an application that allows the user to create and save notes for future reference. Using two NPM packages (Express and Uniqid), the notes created will be saved and will also be allowed to be returned in a JSON file. The user will be able to create notes and have it automatically saved so that the user can keep a clear track of what needs to be or has been completed. With addition to a cleaner organization system, the user can manage all the notes created.

  ## Usage
  This project will be used for users who need an application that will constantly track any notes created and save them for future reference. That way the user can keep track of all notes or tasks without having to remember everything in the back of their head and overthink whether or not they have completed or came across the note.

  ## Installation 
  With the github link provided at the bottom of this README, clone the repository to the local desktop. Before you can use the application, make sure you have the most recent version of Node installed. Once the repository is cloned, proceed to the integrated terminal and type "node server.js" to make sure that the localhost :3001 is fully functional. Once that step is complete,  locate the preferred browser that you will be running the application on. In the URL form,  type "localhost:3001" which will take you to the starting page of the application where you can proceed to take and save notes.
