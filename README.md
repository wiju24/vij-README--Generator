# README Generator

## Description

This application that was created is a README Generator. Save the hassle without having to create an entire README file from scratch and use this one command line application. This will allow the user to type whatever they feel is needed in each section of the README without having to organize every category and searching through various licenses. 

With this application, alongside the installation of the most recent version of Node, there will be easy access within the terminal to fill in the blanks of the README file and not miss out on anything.

## Usage

This application will be used heavily in every application that will be assembled as a README is a vital piece of information for the user. If one was to create an unorganized README, the user/client will not get a good first impression of what to look forward to. With a template, pre-generated, the user simply has to fill in what information they feel will intrigue the user.

## Installation

```
The following steps below will elaborate the installation process on how it will be run.

1. Go to https://github.com/wiju24/vij-README--Generator and clone the repository to your local computer

2. Once cloned, make sure the latest version of Node is installed to your working station

3. Once installed, proceed to the integrated terminal and installed the specified version of Inquirer (npm i inquirer@8.2.4)

4. After both have been installed, under that same integrated terminal, type in "node index.js". This will give the user the prompts to fill in the README file.

5. After completion, the created README file will be located in the folder as the cloned file from the repository and ready to be used.
```
